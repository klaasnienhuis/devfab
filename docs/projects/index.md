# Projects

Projects demonstrate different uses of the Sketchafb API. They are either demos or prototypes, or real-world projects. These projects combine multiple aspects of the API. Here I will explain what's happening and how to reproduce the results yourself.

Before trying out these projects yourself, I highly recommend you go through the [Getting started](../guide/model-loading/getting-started.html) tutorial. It will give you a good understanding of the basics of the API.
